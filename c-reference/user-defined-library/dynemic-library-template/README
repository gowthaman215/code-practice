	This is Utility cum testing library so that to design, implement, and test specific unit (ie,. 
	Functions) of a Product. file and directory structure of this library is simlary to that of 
	Business application (ie., Softwer Product).


	The Main Motivation of this project is to ease unit testing and organise all functions so that 
	it can be easily accessible and resuable in other application also.



Directory/File Structure of Function Library

How to create, remove, Modify or Test Fuctions
=============================================


Since it can be any of module based on c like functions or on c++ class methods, We must seperate it as
different file so that to identify and analyse each easily as posible.

Three key slogan to make and edit each modules and functions are as follows

* Create new Module if Function does not have any relationship with Existing Module and add functionalities
* Modify/Remove functions and its dependent areas call to the fuctions
* Test functions independently with menu driven user interface.
